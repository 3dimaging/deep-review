## Introduction

### Potential writing prompt

One potential future that we could imagine is a world in which data, once
gathered, is rapidly integrated into our understanding of living systems
(STUDY). What we learn is rapidly put to use. Our health-related activities are
constantly monitored (e.g. by wearables) and all of our interactions with health
care systems are extensively tracked. These sources of information are combined
to help to guide our health care and maintenance. (CATEGORIZE) We'd be able to
compare our state and trajectory to (anonymized) others, and identify means to
improve our health. (TREAT) These means might contain drug combinations selected
based on personalized predictions.

### If this happens, is deep learning required for any of it? Are we any closer
### because of the advent of deep learning?

*"Categorize" and "treat" sound a bit like PMI goals. Another way to think about
this would be: do we think that deep learning will make much of a difference
for the precision medicine initiative (PMI)?*

### General deep learning introduction

*Definitions, specific architectures, etc.  We may want to clarify what we mean
by "deep" learning when most methods use few hidden layers.*
